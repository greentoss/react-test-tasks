In this homework, you should create a web page and provide styles for specific screen resolutions as shown in the pictures (pixel perfect is not required):
●	examples/desktop.png - shows how the page should look like on 1280px
●	examples/tablet.png - shows how the page should look like on 768px
●	examples/mobile.png - shows how the page should look like on 320px
     
Requirements:
●	The @media query breakpoints that are used in the example:
○	Mobile < 768px 
○	Tablet min-width: 768px 
○	Desktop min-width: 1280px  

●	You can use mobile first or desktop first approach. It’s up to you;


Navigation and first section have width: 100%.
●	The even posts should have description on the left and preview image on the right
●	The odd posts should have description on the right and preview image on the left (reverse)
Please note! This logic should not be ‘hardcoded’ in HTML or CSS. Please use appropriate pseudo-class to place elements. 
So, in case we need to add a new post, then the last added item should be shown reversed regarding the previous one. 

●	In styles.css file you can find colors references. Please don`t forget to remove unnecessary comments after you use it.
